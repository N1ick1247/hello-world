# hello-world
Initial repository hope all goes well and a way to look back at how much I grow 

Here's my first change I'm making a commitment to make my life better and apply
 myself toward a valuable skillset in order to financially expand my horizons. A 
Little about me I'm 30, just recently met the love of my life and am now realizing 
I should have finished getting a career a long time ago to get her everything she could
Ever have instead of what she just wants me. I finished two years of electrical
Engineering at University of Arizona and held a job at Eller it so I already know a bit 
Of coding so I decided in my free time I'll expand my knowledge doing side projects.
